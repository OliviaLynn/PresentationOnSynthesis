Intro to Sound Synthesis

What we'll cover:
- like
- three
- topics

(should I mention that what we're doing is additive synth?)

Start with a sine wave
It has a frequency, and an amplitude
Frequency is a lot like pitch,
  except that pitch is relative--a social construct, if you will--and frequency is based on definite numbers
This is what our wave would sound like at a lower frequency
  and at higher frequencies
If you notice, I've been working with multiples of two here
  this frequency is exactly half of the one before it
  and this is half of the one before that one
  When you double or half a frequency, you move by an octave
  But, we can also move by other amounts, like so
Out wave also has an amplitude
  Right now, we're working with an amp of 1 dB
  a lower amplitude would sound, as you might guess, softer
  And back to 1
Two things worth noting when talking about amplitude are loudness and decibels
  We can think of amplitudes lot like how loud a sound is,
  but technically loudness is the way we perceive amplitude
  So, two waves with the same amplitude might have different loudnesses
  based on their frequencies and/or their timbres
Decibels are the unit we use for amplitude
  a decibel is technically a ratio, and not an absolute amount
  So, we can say "two feet" and that means something around this--
  But "two decibels" would be something closer to "twice as powerful"
  (although, as an aside, decibels work on logarithmic scales, so 2dB would actually be more equivalent to "10 times")
  So, it has less meaning if we haven't already defined some sound as our reference point to build ratios off of
  But surely this is impractical!
  How can we talk to other people about amplitudes if it be like this?
  the dB is often used to quantify SPL, or Sound Pressure Levels, relative to a 0dB reference
  and we can set 0dB to the "threshold of hearing", the SPL that's juuuust high enough for us to hear

So we've just covered frequency and amplitude
  It's good to note that sounds also have a timbre, too
  This here is a sine wave, but if we change it to a triangle wave...
  it has a different timbre
  And a square wave, or pulse wave

Okay, so ("with freq and amp", if we've gone off into tangents)
we have everything we need to keep going.

Now, let's take a look at this same wave on a different graph.
Right now we're looking at a graph that shows amplitude as a
function of time - that is to say, if we give our function a time,
it will tell us what amplitude will be playing.
We can also represent this sound with a "frequency domain" graph,
where we keep the amplitude along the y-axis but replace the x-axis
(our domain) with frequency instead of time.
This is a sine wave with a frequency of --, so we get--
(switch)
this. Very exciting.
(maybe something about how sine waves are "pure" - this sound
doesn't just sound pure, it's also pretty pure and simple to
work with in synthesis, too.)

So let's switch back to a (is it correct to say time-domain?)
graph.
We're gonna try playing two sine waves at once
(add a higher partial to our sine wave, maybe the original
"higher pitch" sine)
When we play two sounds at the same time, we add their waves
(do I need to step people through adding the waves?)
If we switch back to our frequency domain, we can see it just got
(gasp) a little bit more interesting
What if we make it even more interesting?
(add a couple more sounds)
What does our time domain graph look like now?
(switch)
Wow! That looks suspiciously more and more like our squarwe wave
from earlier.
It might be hard to hear it that way, because we added each sine
wave one at a time, but if we pause for a few seconds
(pause)
then start up again, we can recognise this as a square wave.

(Then explain how this is a fourier transform?)

If we want a close approximation to a square wave, we can just
keep adding sine waves at higher frequencies
(examples)

We can also approximate triangle and sawtooth waves this way, too
(saw example)

((what's the meaning of this? bc DAC plays, like, steps, but
something interpolated from sample to sample, right?
or does this just help us understand how to get frequencies from
the time domain graphs we normally see?
or i guess this is definitely at least a helpful intro to
additive synthesis))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TOSPECT?

(then I guess we can show how we can compact the frequency domain
to a single line with varying colors, then stack those to form a
spectrograph)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SUBTRACT?

(then on to subtractive synthesis?)
(then maybe go on to explain envelopes and how we can apply that
to different formants in add. synth. to get things like brass
sounds?)
(or go straight to FM synth?)
