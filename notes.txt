Intro to Sound Synthesis

What we'll cover:
- like
- three
- topics

(should I mention that what we're doing is additive synth?)

Start with a sine wave
(show oscilliscope, play sound)
It has a pitch, or frequency
This is what it would sound like at a higher pitch -ex-
or a lower pitch -ex-
It also has an amplitude
Right now, our sound's amplitude is --
Naturally, a lower amplitude like -- would sound like this -ex-
(maybe mention diff between ampl and loudness?
maybe mention dB is a ratio?)

(Potentially mention: we're looking at a sine wave rn.
Other common waveforms to use include triangle, saw, square/pulse
(w/ examples). Each of these have had the same frequency and
amplitude, but a different ~timbre~. We're gonna hop back to
sine waves rn, but ----)
(Maybe mention spelling vs pronunciation, plus french etymology
of timbre)

Okay, so ("with freq and amp", if we've gone off into tangents)
we have everything we need to keep going.

Now, let's take a look at this same wave on a different graph.
Right now we're looking at a graph that shows amplitude as a
function of time - that is to say, if we give our function a time,
it will tell us what amplitude will be playing.
We can also represent this sound with a "frequency domain" graph,
where we keep the amplitude along the y-axis but replace the x-axis
(our domain) with frequency instead of time.
This is a sine wave with a frequency of --, so we get--
(switch)
this. Very exciting.
(maybe something about how sine waves are "pure" - this sound
doesn't just sound pure, it's also pretty pure and simple to
work with in synthesis, too.)

So let's switch back to a (is it correct to say time-domain?)
graph.
We're gonna try playing two sine waves at once
(add a higher partial to our sine wave, maybe the original
"higher pitch" sine)
When we play two sounds at the same time, we add their waves
(do I need to step people through adding the waves?)
If we switch back to our frequency domain, we can see it just got
(gasp) a little bit more interesting
What if we make it even more interesting?
(add a couple more sounds)
What does our time domain graph look like now?
(switch)
Wow! That looks suspiciously more and more like our squarwe wave
from earlier.
It might be hard to hear it that way, because we added each sine
wave one at a time, but if we pause for a few seconds
(pause)
then start up again, we can recognise this as a square wave.

(Then explain how this is a fourier transform?)

If we want a close approximation to a square wave, we can just
keep adding sine waves at higher frequencies
(examples)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ BUILDSAW

We can also approximate triangle and sawtooth waves this way, too
(saw example)

((what's the meaning of this? bc DAC plays, like, steps, but
something interpolated from sample to sample, right?
or does this just help us understand how to get frequencies from
the time domain graphs we normally see?
or i guess this is definitely at least a helpful intro to
additive synthesis))

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ TOSPECT?

(then I guess we can show how we can compact the frequency domain
to a single line with varying colors, then stack those to form a
spectrograph)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SUBTRACT?

(then on to subtractive synthesis?)
(then maybe go on to explain envelopes and how we can apply that
to different formants in add. synth. to get things like brass
sounds?)
(or go straight to FM synth?)
